# TicTacToeGame
Includes a GUI for the client and server allowing multiple games of Tic Tac Toe to run concurrently using Transmission Control Protocol.

This program was written with Java version 8. 

For the client side:
To use this program you must first enter in some credentials which will be a user name and the ip address you wish to connect to. The server will pair you up with another client and a game of Tic Tac Toe will be started. The left side of the GUI holds the gameboard which is enabled when it is your turn. A client can disconnect and close the game at any time if they click the disconnect button.

For the server side:
To use this program you must click connect and wait for the server to display traffic and connections. Two clients must connect to the server before traffic is displayed. Clicking disconnect will close the connection and close the server.
